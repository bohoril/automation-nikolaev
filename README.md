## Project Structure
- `pages/`: Contains the Page Object Model (POM) classes.
- `tests/`: Contains the test scripts.
- `utils/`: Contains utilities.

## Explanation of Approach

### TypeScript
TypeScript is used for its static typing, which helps catch errors early during development and improves code quality.
Additionally, TypeScript is natively supported by Playwright, and it is a part of the company tech stack.

### Playwright
Playwright is chosen for its ability to automate modern web applications across different browsers with ease.
It provides powerful features for end-to-end testing just out of the box.

### Page Object Model (POM)
The POM pattern is used to create an abstraction layer between the test scripts and the UI.
This makes the tests more maintainable and reusable.

### Logging
The `pino` library is used for logging due to its performance and flexibility.
The `pino-pretty` is used to format the logs for better readability.

### Reporting
The project uses the `@playwright/test` built-in reporter to generate test reports.

### CI/CD
The project is set up to run on GitHub Actions. The CI/CD pipeline is triggered on every push to the `main` branch.
